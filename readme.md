Welcome to the Learning Framer Motion repository! 🎉 This project is my journey into mastering Framer Motion 🎞️, a powerful library for animations in React ⚛️, used to create smooth, interactive animations for modern web applications. Here, I will document what I learn 📘, share example code 💻, and showcase animation techniques ✨. This repository serves as a practical guide to various animation types, gestures 🖱️, and interaction-based effects, providing code snippets and examples to illustrate Framer Motion concepts.
